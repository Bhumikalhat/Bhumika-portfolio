### Notes / Next Steps
- Replace profile placeholder with `src/assets/profile.jpg`.
- Update any copy in components to match your preferred wording.
- Add project links (GitHub, live demo) to the Projects array.
- If you prefer Create React App instead of Vite, I can provide a CRA-specific setup.

Good luck — the full project is above. Copy files into a repository and I can guide you through deployment to Vercel next.
